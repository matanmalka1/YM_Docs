# Frontend Page Structure Standard

Read this file before refactoring any page.

## Folder structure

The canonical feature file layout and naming rules live in
`docs/frontend/architecture.md` § Feature file layout (source of truth). Summary:

```
features/<feature>/
  api/                       — always a folder, never a flat api.ts
    <feature>.api.ts         — HTTP calls only, no business logic
    contracts.ts             — request/response types, Zod schemas
    endpoints.ts  queryKeys.ts  index.ts
  pages/
    <Feature>Page.tsx        — thin orchestrator, no API calls, no logic
  hooks/
    use<Feature>Page.ts      — primary page hook (flat); UI-state hooks flat
    queries/  mutations/      — data-read / data-write hooks (when a feature
                                has enough hooks to warrant the split)
  components/                — .tsx ONLY (no hooks/constants/utils here)
    list/ detail/ form/ dialogs/ shared/   — area subfolders; group when the
                                feature has >=5 components, else keep flat
    <Feature><Thing>.tsx     — PascalCase, feature-prefixed
  utils/                     — always a folder
  constants.ts               — bare (or constants/ folder for multiple groups)
  schemas.ts  types.ts  index.ts
```

Feature-root files stay bare (folder is the namespace); `components/` and every
subfolder under it hold `.tsx` only — pure logic lives in `hooks/`, `utils/`,
`constants.ts`/`constants/`, `schemas.ts`. Not every file is required; create only
what the domain actually needs.

---

## Page component rules

- Page = orchestration only. Layout + slot-filling. Nothing else.
- No direct `useQuery` or `useMutation` calls inside Page.
- No API calls inside Page.
- Page consumes **exactly one** page-level hook: `useXPage()`. If a page needs an
  actions/confirmations concern (`useXActions`), `useXPage` **composes it internally**
  and re-exposes its surface through the grouped slots — the page does not call a
  second hook (see WorkQueue / Binders precedent).
- The page is pure slot composition: destructure the grouped slots and spread them
  into slot components. No `useState`/`useEffect`/`useMemo`/`useNavigate`/
  `useSearchParams`/`build*Columns` in the page.
- Usually under ~80 lines. Exception allowed if the page only composes sections and contains no logic.
- If the page already matches this standard, do not refactor it. Document it as compliant.

```tsx
// Good — grouped slots, pure composition
export function ClientsPage() {
  const { status, headerProps, stats, filters, table, drawers, modals } = useClientsPage()
  return (
    <PageStateGuard isLoading={status.isLoading} error={status.error} header={<PageHeader {...headerProps} />}>
      <ClientsStatsSection {...stats} />
      <ClientsFiltersBar filters={filters.values} onFilterChange={filters.onFilterChange} onReset={filters.resetFilters} />
      <PaginatedDataTable data={table.data} columns={table.columns} onRowClick={table.onRowClick}
        {...table.pagination} emptyState={table.emptyState} />
      <ClientEditDrawer {...drawers.edit} />
      <CreateClientModal {...modals.createProps} />
    </PageStateGuard>
  )
}
```

### Grouped page-hook contract (slots)

`useXPage()` returns **named, grouped slots** (naming/location convention — not a
shared TS type). Reference implementation: `useBindersPage` + `BindersPage.tsx`.

| Slot | Shape / purpose |
|------|-----------------|
| `status` | `{ isLoading; isFetching; error: string \| null; loadingMessage? }` — error converted to a string in the hook, never in the page |
| `headerProps` | `{ title; description?; actions? }` — **data, not rendered JSX** |
| `stats` | feature-owned stats props (one slot) |
| `filters` | feature-owned filter values + handlers, including `resetFilters()` |
| `table` | `{ data; columns; pagination?; emptyState?; selection? }` — page renders `table.data`/`table.columns`, never `page.<entityPlural>`; columns built in the hook/a feature helper, never in page JSX |
| `modals` / `drawers` | pre-wired prop objects the page spreads (`<X {...modals.createProps} />`) |
| `permissions` | capability booleans grouped under one name (keep a `can` object if the feature already exposes one) |

**Structural Definition of Done — the page must own NONE of:** query calls, URL
parsing/effects/navigation, column construction, modal/drawer state, loading/error
conversion, empty-state derivation. Hooks return config (not JSX).

**Sanctioned exception:** header action buttons may stay page-composed JSX
(label + icon) wired to a hook callback (e.g. `modals.openCreate`), because
`PageHeader.actions` is a `ReactNode`. Do not build a config→button mapper for this.

### Rendering variants (pick by existing behavior — never convert one to the other)

1. **Guarded** — wrap the body in `PageStateGuard` (fed by `status`). Use when the
   whole body should be hidden during load.
2. **Section-loading variant** — NO top-level `PageStateGuard`; header + filters
   (+ stats) render unconditionally and a composite section component owns its own
   loading/error/empty. Use when filters/header must stay visible during load
   (forcing a guard there hides filters = behavior change). The hook still returns
   `status`; the page wires `status.isLoading/error/errorFallback` into the section
   component (single source — do not also duplicate them on `table`).

`table.emptyState` (an `EmptyStateConfig`: `isEmpty`, `isFiltered`, copy, action) is
**required** for a raw `PaginatedDataTable`, **optional** when a composite wrapper
already owns empty rendering. `table.selection` (bulk select) is bulk-list pages only
and nests under `table`, not its own top-level slot.

---

## Hook rules

- `use<Domain>Page` owns: page orchestration, query state, filter state, derived state, modal/drawer state, and returns the grouped slot contract (above). It **composes** smaller feature hooks (`useXFilters`/`useXActions`/`useXDialogs`/a second data hook) internally rather than becoming a dump — the page still consumes only `useXPage`.
- `use<Domain>Filters` owns: filter shape, URL sync, reset logic. Use when filter logic exceeds ~30 lines.
- `use<Domain>Actions` owns: mutations, confirmation dialogs, optimistic updates.
- Hooks return config (data + callbacks + column definitions). Hooks must **not** return rendered JSX (no `<PageHeader/>`, buttons, modals, drawers, or arbitrary nodes).
- Hooks must not import from other feature hooks unless there is an explicit cross-domain dependency.

---

## Component rules

- Components receive data via props. They do not fetch their own data.
- Components do not call `useQuery`, `useMutation`, or feature API hooks directly.
- Exception: a documented feature-level widget may load the resource it owns. Keep its presentational
  children fetch-free.
- Shared UI primitives live in `src/components/ui/`.
- Shared cross-feature widgets live in `src/components/shared/`.
- Do not move domain-specific UI into shared.
- Extract to shared only after 2–3 real usages across different domains.
- Shared must not import feature APIs, React Query feature hooks, or business logic.
- Feature widgets may use their own feature-level hooks, but presentational components must not fetch.

---

## API layer rules

- `<domain>Api.ts` contains HTTP calls only. No business logic, no state.
- `contracts.ts` contains request/response types and Zod schemas.
- Endpoint constants and query-key factories remain feature-local.
- API methods must return typed data and preserve backend nullability.
- Use the shared Axios client and shared query-param serializer.
- API modules must not show toasts, navigate, or invalidate React Query caches.
- Reusable enum option arrays should live in constants files, not inline in multiple components.
- HTTP calls must go through the shared Axios client.
- Query keys must be feature-local, serializable, and stable.

---

## Import rules

- Use `@/` for imports outside the current module folder.
- A feature may import its own internals directly.
- **Never import from a feature's own root barrel inside that feature.** Inside `features/X/**`, do not import from `@/features/X` (the root `index.ts`) — use direct relative imports (`./useThing`, `../api`, `../components/Thing`). Root-barrel self-imports risk same-feature cycles. A sub-barrel like `../api` is fine.
- **Nothing in `components/` or `hooks/` may import from `pages/`.** Page-level constants/helpers that components or hooks also need belong at the feature root (`features/X/constants.ts`), not under `pages/`.
- **Page-role components live in `pages/`, not `components/`.** A component used directly as a route element must sit under `pages/`.
- Import another feature's non-component API only from that feature's public `index.ts`.
- Do not deep-import another feature's hooks, API, schemas, types, constants, or utilities.
- Pages may compose exported cross-feature components. Reusable cross-feature logic still belongs
  behind the owning feature's public barrel.
- Keep every feature `index.ts` intentional: export only the surface other features are allowed to
  depend on.

---

## URL state rules

- search / filter / sort / page / page_size that should survive refresh → URL params.
- Modal open state → local state (unless product requires deep-linkable modals).
- Selected drawer/row id → URL param only if the product requires a shareable link.
- Never duplicate a URL param into local state as a shadow copy.
- `useSearchParamFilters` is the standard hook for URL filter sync. Use its `setFilter` / `setFilters` / `resetFilters` / `setPage` helpers for all writes, and `getParam(key)` / `getPage()` for reads. Never hand-roll `new URLSearchParams(searchParams)` mutations inline.
- URL params and `<select>` values are external strings. Enum-backed filters must parse them with a
  feature-owned guard/parser before assigning typed state or building API params. Invalid enum values
  should normalize to the presentation sentinel (`''`) or omission (`undefined`/`null`), not be cast
  with `as SomeEnum`.

---

## List page standard

Every List page must handle all of these consistently:

| Concern | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| `search` | Debounced 300–500ms, URL param |
| `filters` | URL params, reset-all supported |
| `sort_by` / `order` | URL params (sort direction param is `order` with `asc`/`desc`, per `docs/architecture/api-contracts.md`) |
| `page` / `page_size` | URL params (or cursor if backend uses cursor) |
| Loading state | Skeleton or spinner |
| Empty state | Distinct `<XEmptyState />` component |
| Error state | Error message + retry action |

---

## Page type classification

Classify every page before refactoring:

| Type | Characteristics |
|------|----------------|
| **List** | Table, filters, pagination, bulk actions |
| **Detail** | Header, tabs/sections, drawers, related entities |
| **Dashboard** | Widgets, cross-feature composition |
| **Public** | No auth shell, different loading/error behavior |
| **Settings** | Forms, save/reset, dirty state, optimistic updates |
| **Wizard/Form** | Multi-step state, validation, draft state |

Type determines which hooks and components are expected.

Client-details tabs (rendered under `/clients/:clientId/<tab>`) must additionally follow
`docs/frontend/client-tab-contract.md`.

---

## Naming rules

- Names must be explicit and domain-specific.
- No generic names: `BaseCrudPage`, `GenericTable`, `usePageHook`.
- Clickable stat bars that are built from `StatsCard`, wired to the page `stats` slot, and used as
  status/filter toggles should be named `<Feature>StatsSection`. Non-interactive metric summaries
  are not covered by this rule.
- Do not rename files unless the rename is required by this standard.
- Prefer moving logic over cosmetic reshuffling.

---

## What not to do

- Do not call API hooks directly from Page.
- Do not keep a second in-memory copy of URL filter state.
- Do not derive product-facing totals from a partial page of server data.
- Prefer targeted cache updates/invalidation. Avoid broad `invalidateQueries` unless the mutation affects multiple unknown views.
- Do not create `BaseCrudPage` or any generic mega-abstraction.
- Do not extract to shared before 2–3 real cross-domain usages.
- Do not refactor a page that already matches this standard.
