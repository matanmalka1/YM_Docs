# Signature Requests

Manages the full lifecycle of digital signature requests sent to clients for legally-binding approval of documents. Built under Israeli Electronic Signature Law 5761-2001: every request anchors to a `client_record_id`, carries a one-time signing token, captures a content hash for tamper detection, and records every lifecycle transition in an append-only audit trail.

Last verified against code + backend/openapi.json: 2026-05-29.

## Endpoints

### Advisor routes (JWT required — roles: `ADVISOR`, `SECRETARY`)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | /api/v1/signature-requests | Create and immediately send a signature request |
| GET | /api/v1/signature-requests/pending | List all `pending_signature` requests (paginated) |
| GET | /api/v1/signature-requests/{request_id} | Get request details + embedded audit trail |
| POST | /api/v1/signature-requests/{request_id}/cancel | Cancel a pending request |
| GET | /api/v1/clients/{client_record_id}/signature-requests | List all requests for a client record (paginated, filterable by status) |

### Public signer routes (no JWT — token-based)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | /sign/{token} | Signer views the request; records `viewed` audit event |
| POST | /sign/{token}/approve | Signer approves; transitions `pending_signature → signed` |
| POST | /sign/{token}/decline | Signer declines; transitions `pending_signature → declined` |

All paths confirmed in `backend/openapi.json`.

## Enums / statuses

### `SignatureRequestStatus`

Source: `backend/app/signature_requests/models/signature_request.py:40`

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `pending_signature` | Awaiting signer action |
| `signed` | Signer approved |
| `declined` | Signer declined |
| `expired` | Past `expires_at` with no action |
| `canceled` | Canceled by advisor or system |

State machine: `pending_signature → signed | declined | expired | canceled`. All transitions are terminal.

### `SignatureRequestType`

Source: `backend/app/signature_requests/models/signature_request.py:48`

| Value | Hebrew label |
|-------|-------------|
| `engagement_agreement` | הסכם התקשרות |
| `annual_report_approval` | אישור דוח שנתי |
| `power_of_attorney` | ייפוי כוח |
| `vat_return_approval` | אישור דוח מע"מ |
| `custom` | חתימה כללית |

### `event_type` values (audit trail)

`event_type` and `actor_type` are plain `String` columns — intentionally not enum, so new event types require no migration. Known values: `created`, `sent`, `viewed`, `signed`, `declined`, `canceled`, `expired`, `annual_report_signed`.

Source: `backend/app/signature_requests/models/signature_request.py:24`, `services/messages.py`.

## Domain rules & invariants

Source: `backend/app/signature_requests/services/`

1. **`client_record_id` always required.** Every request must belong to a client record. Checked at creation; raises `CLIENT_RECORD.NOT_FOUND` if missing. (`create_request.py:57-59`)

2. **`business_id` ownership validated on create.** When `business_id` is provided, it must belong to the `legal_entity_id` of the client record. Delegates to `assert_business_belongs_to_legal_entity`. (`create_request.py:62-68`)

3. **Signer contact fallback.** If `signer_email` or `signer_phone` is absent and `business_id` is set, values are pulled from the business profile via `BusinessContactService`. (`create_request.py:69-75`)

4. **`request_type` validated against enum.** Invalid values raise `SIGNATURE_REQUEST.INVALID_TYPE`. (`create_request.py:77-85`)

5. **Content hash computed server-side.** If caller supplies `content_to_hash`, the service computes `SHA-256` and stores it. Callers never write `content_hash` directly. (`create_request.py:88-90`)

6. **Token is unguessable and one-time.** Generated with `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`. Cleared (`NULL`) immediately upon any terminal transition (signed / declined / canceled / expired). (`create_request.py:109`, `signer_actions.py:77-85`, `admin_actions.py:38-43`)

7. **Row-level lock on state transitions.** `sign_request`, `decline_request`, and `cancel_request` all use `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` via `get_by_token_for_update` / `get_by_id_for_update` to prevent race conditions. (`signature_request_validations.py:29-37`, `47-54`)

8. **Signer actions require `pending_signature` status.** `assert_pending` raises `SIGNATURE_REQUEST.INVALID_STATUS` if not pending. (`signature_request_validations.py:57-67`)

9. **Runtime expiry detection.** If `expires_at` has passed at the time of a signer action, the service atomically transitions to `EXPIRED`, clears the token, appends an `expired` audit event, and raises `SIGNATURE_REQUEST.EXPIRED`. (`signer_actions.py:28-37`)

10. **Cancel only from `pending_signature`.** Raises `SIGNATURE_REQUEST.INVALID_STATUS` if status is anything else. (`admin_actions.py:32-36`)

11. **Batch expiry job.** `expire_overdue_requests()` scans all `pending_signature` rows past `expires_at`, transitions them to `EXPIRED`, and appends audit events. Intended for a periodic scheduler. (`admin_actions.py:59-79`)

12. **Annual-report auto-advance on sign.** When a signed request has `annual_report_id` set and `request_type = annual_report_approval`, `SignatureRequestService.sign_request` attempts a best-effort `pending_client → submitted` transition and sets `client_approved_at`. The call is wrapped in `try/except` — failure is logged, not surfaced to the signer. (`signature_request_service.py:84-108`)

13. **Audit trail is append-only.** `SignatureAuditEvent` has no `updated_at` and no soft-delete. Events for `created` and `sent` are always appended together at creation. (`create_request.py:115-130`, model docstring)

14. **`signer_ip_address` excluded from API responses.** Intentionally omitted from `SignatureRequestResponse` schema to avoid PII exposure. Available only in the audit trail. (`schemas/signature_request.py:55`)

15. **List by client returns all statuses by default.** Optional `status` query param filters; invalid values raise `SIGNATURE_REQUEST.INVALID_STATUS`. (`signature_request_service.py:157-167`)

## Error codes

Source: `backend/app/signature_requests/services/`, `docs/architecture/error-codes.md`.

| Code | HTTP | When raised |
|------|------|-------------|
| `SIGNATURE_REQUEST.NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Request ID not found |
| `SIGNATURE_REQUEST.INVALID_TYPE` | 400 | `request_type` not in enum |
| `SIGNATURE_REQUEST.INVALID_STATUS` | 400 | Status check failed (cancel non-pending; signer action on terminal; invalid filter) |
| `SIGNATURE_REQUEST.TOKEN_INVALID` | 400 | Token not found or already cleared |
| `SIGNATURE_REQUEST.EXPIRED` | 400/410 | Signer action attempted after `expires_at` |
| `CLIENT_RECORD.NOT_FOUND` | 404 | `client_record_id` not found at create or list |
| `BUSINESS.NOT_FOUND` | 404 | `business_id` not found at create |

All codes follow `DOMAIN.REASON` format. Registry: `docs/architecture/error-codes.md`.

## Known issues

### F-021 — Low | `GET /{request_id}` bypasses error envelope

**What:** `routes_advisor.py:83` raises `fastapi.HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="בקשת החתימה לא נמצאה")` directly instead of raising `NotFoundError("...", "SIGNATURE_REQUEST.NOT_FOUND")`. This bypasses the global `AppError` handler and returns a raw FastAPI error body instead of the structured `{error: {code, message, ...}}` envelope.

**Location:** `backend/app/signature_requests/api/routes_advisor.py:83`

**Rule violated:** All 404s in this domain should be `NotFoundError` with a `DOMAIN.REASON` code (consistent with every other route in this module and the global error-codes contract).

**Suggested fix:** Replace the `if not req: raise HTTPException(...)` block with a call to `signature_request_validations.get_or_raise(repo, request_id)` or simply raise `NotFoundError(…, "SIGNATURE_REQUEST.NOT_FOUND")`.

---

### F-022 — Medium (IDOR) | Cancel has no client ownership check

**What:** `POST /api/v1/signature-requests/{request_id}/cancel` accepts any `request_id` without verifying the request belongs to a client record accessible to the calling advisor. The service calls `get_or_raise_for_update(repo, request_id)` which only confirms the row exists — it does not check `client_record_id` ownership. Any authenticated `ADVISOR`/`SECRETARY` can cancel any signature request in the system.

**Location:** `backend/app/signature_requests/services/admin_actions.py:26-35`, `backend/app/signature_requests/api/routes_advisor.py:89-103`

**Rule violated:** Same pattern as F-001 (annual-reports) and F-008 (vat-reports): mutating operations must re-validate that the target belongs to the caller's accessible scope.

**Suggested fix:** Add a `client_record_id` parameter to `cancel_request`, looked up from the route or a preceding authorization check, and assert `req.client_record_id == expected_client_record_id` before transitioning.

---

### F-023 — Low (dead artifact) | Stale `send_request.cpython-314.pyc` with no source

**What:** `backend/app/signature_requests/services/__pycache__/send_request.cpython-314.pyc` exists but there is no `send_request.py` source file in the same `services/` directory. This indicates a module that was deleted (or never committed) but whose compiled bytecode was left behind. If any code attempts `from app.signature_requests.services import send_request`, Python may load the stale `.pyc`.

**Location:** `backend/app/signature_requests/services/__pycache__/send_request.cpython-314.pyc`

**Rule violated:** Pattern 5 (broken/stale imports and dead references).

**Suggested fix:** Delete the orphaned `.pyc` file; add `__pycache__` to `.gitignore` if not already present.

## Decisions (preserved)

From `backend/app/signature_requests/README.md` (audited 2026-03-22) and model docstring:

1. **`client_record_id` as primary anchor.** Signature requests are anchored to the legal entity record, not to a specific business, because the signer is typically the legal representative of the entity. `business_id` is optional context.

2. **`signing_token` is cleared after terminal state.** Once a request reaches `signed`, `declined`, `canceled`, or `expired`, the token is set to `NULL`. This prevents replay of a previously-used token.

3. **`event_type` and `actor_type` are `String`, not enum.** Allows the audit trail to gain new event types without schema migrations. This is a deliberate tradeoff: type safety is sacrificed for migration-free extensibility.

4. **`SignatureAuditEvent` has no soft delete and no `updated_at`.** The audit trail is legally required to be immutable. Adding delete or update columns would undermine its evidentiary value.

5. **Content hash is SHA-256 of caller-supplied text.** The service does not hash the stored file — it hashes `content_to_hash` provided at creation time. This allows hashing of a canonical serialization without streaming from S3/R2.

6. **Auto-advance of annual report is best-effort.** The `_auto_advance_annual_report` call is inside a broad `try/except Exception` and logs on failure. The signer's action always succeeds regardless of the annual report transition outcome.

7. **Israeli Electronic Signature Law 5761-2001 compliance intent.** The model captures: who was asked (signer identity), when asked (sent_at), what they approved (content_hash), and how they confirmed (signed_at + signer_ip_address + signer_user_agent). These four elements satisfy the audit-trail requirement.

## Future / planned

- **Countersigned PDF storage** (`signed_document_key`): The column `signed_document_key` exists in the model for a countersigned PDF to be stored in S3/R2 after approval, but no service currently writes to it. The feature is scaffolded, not implemented.

- **Batch expiry scheduler**: `expire_overdue_requests()` is implemented in `admin_actions.py` but there is no evidence of a background job or cron that calls it (cf. F-016 pattern in reminders). Expiry at signer-action time works; batch sweep relies on a scheduler being wired up.

- **Notification delivery**: No email/SMS sending is implemented in the signature request creation flow. The response returns `signing_url_hint` for the advisor to distribute manually.
