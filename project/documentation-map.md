## Scope

This file owns only:

- The map of documentation areas and where agents look.
- References to existing domain docs without normalizing them.

This file must not contain:

- Full rules copied from other docs.
- Domain documentation rewrites or migrations.

Source of truth: reference

# Documentation Map

Official docs index and navigation map. Paths are relative to the root of the project docs repo. **★ = source of truth** (mandatory/binding).

## Precedence

- ADRs override all other docs when relevant.
- Architecture docs override workflow and project docs for technical rules.
- Archive docs are historical only and are not source of truth.

## Start here

- `AGENTS.md` — top-level entry pointer for agents.
- `docs/agent/entry-point.md` ★ — canonical project-wide agent instructions; read first.

## Project

- `docs/project/overview.md` — what the product is and its high-level shape.
- `docs/project/documentation-map.md` — this index/navigation map.
- `docs/project/backend-module-map.md` — where backend modules live.
- `docs/project/domain-docs-inventory.md` — list of existing domain-specific docs.
- `docs/project/config-reference.md` — index of backend env/config variables (source: `backend/app/config.py`).
- `docs/project/domain-docs-plan.md` — ownership split + status tracker for the canonical per-domain docs migration.
- `docs/project/annual-reports-todo.md` — reference tracker for unresolved annual-report financial-lines audit follow-ups.

## Architecture (technical source of truth)

- `docs/architecture/update-request-conventions.md` — PATCH/`*UpdateRequest` conventions: empty-PATCH 422, unknown-field rejection, explicit-null semantics, single-payload exceptions, `ClientUpdateRequest` field ownership (non-normative; defers to `api-contracts.md`).
- `docs/architecture/error-codes.md` — registry of `DOMAIN.REASON` error-code namespaces + status mapping (non-normative).
- `docs/architecture/database.md` ★ — database modeling rules.
- `docs/architecture/migrations.md` ★ — schema migration rules.

## Legacy backend domain docs (pointers only)

These files under `backend/docs/**` and `backend/app/*/README.md` have been replaced with pointers to the canonical docs above; historical content lives in `docs/archive/`. Do not edit them as sources of truth.
